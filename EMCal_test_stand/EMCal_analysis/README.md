Some scripts to analyze the EMCal readout files (Janus events lists). Running plotRunPHA.py will produce several energy histograms and ROOT files with the event data for each channel (high gain and low gain ADC values). You can then analyze these ROOT files with another script. For example, plotMIPPeak.py will fit the energy distribution for each of the four channels to a Landau distribution and generate plots of the histograms and fitted curves, printing important parameters of the fit.
